# This repository includes all of my code from my Introduction to Computer Science course at Harvard, each assignment in a different branch. The cs50/2018/fall/project/implementation branch contains my final project. Titled "FunFinder", it is an event-finder website whose algorithm matches users with recreational activities in the Boston area based on their personality. In addition, the website displays updated information about local events using Eventful’s API. Another noteworthy project can be found in the cs50/2018/fall/finance branch. This is a simulation website that allows users to manage their own stock portfolios by buying, selling, and displaying stock prices by querying IEX.
